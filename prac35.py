# here its about polymorphism where it mean "having " diffrent forms as we can seen below example where we do a same operation but there is type is diffreent as python has some programmatic theory or algortihm that can deternmin the type and perform operation accordingly

print(1+2) #3
print(type(1))
print("apana" + "college") #concatenate
print(type("apana"))
print([1,2,3]+[1,2,3]) #merge
print(type([1,2,3]))
